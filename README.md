# Blindfold 

## Introduction
This script could and should be useful for the most of roleplay servers, it fills the whole screen with a united color, in this case black or brown. Why? Because there are some roleplayers who'd like to extract the text from a screen, they can modify it in programs such as Photoshop to make it transparent.
